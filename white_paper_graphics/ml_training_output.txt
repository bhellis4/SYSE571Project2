PREDICTION VALIDATION EXAMPLES
============================================================

Example 1 - High Credit Score Individual:
----------------------------------------
Demographics: Age 74, Income $211,448, Credit Score 833, Employment Status: 0 (unemployed)
Actual Risk Category: Low Risk
Predicted Risk Category: Low Risk ✓ CORRECT
Predicted Risk Score: 76.9 (Actual: 57.0) - Model predicted higher risk
Predicted Resilience Score: 88.7 (Actual: 100.0) - Model predicted realistic resilience

Analysis: Despite unemployment, high credit score and income resulted in low risk classification.
Model correctly identified low risk but provided more conservative risk score than original assessment.

Example 2 - Moderate Profile Individual:
---------------------------------------
Demographics: Age 72, Income $110,872, Credit Score 699, Employment Status: 0 (unemployed)
Actual Risk Category: Medium Risk
Predicted Risk Category: Medium Risk ✓ CORRECT
Predicted Risk Score: 58.8 (Actual: 65.0) - Close prediction
Predicted Resilience Score: 67.2 (Actual: 54.0) - Model predicted higher resilience

Analysis: Moderate credit score with unemployment correctly classified as medium risk.
Model predictions closely aligned with actual scores.

Example 3 - High Risk Individual:
--------------------------------
Demographics: Age 48, Income $132,078, Credit Score 459, Employment Status: 0 (unemployed)
Actual Risk Category: High Risk
Predicted Risk Category: High Risk ✓ CORRECT
Predicted Risk Score: 87.6 (Actual: 79.0) - Model predicted higher risk
Predicted Resilience Score: 53.7 (Actual: 54.0) - Excellent resilience prediction

Analysis: Poor credit score despite decent income resulted in high risk classification.
Model accurately identified high risk and provided precise resilience assessment.

Example 4 - Young Adult Profile:
-------------------------------
Demographics: Age 20, Income $111,641, Credit Score 557, Employment Status: 2 (employed)
Actual Risk Category: Medium Risk
Predicted Risk Category: Medium Risk ✓ CORRECT
Predicted Risk Score: 58.0 (Actual: 57.0) - Excellent risk prediction
Predicted Resilience Score: 59.5 (Actual: 51.0) - Moderate resilience prediction

Analysis: Young age with moderate credit and employment correctly classified.
Risk score prediction was highly accurate.

Example 5 - Mid-Career Professional:
-----------------------------------
Demographics: Age 37, Income $135,035, Credit Score 505, Employment Status: 1 (employed)
Actual Risk Category: Medium Risk
Predicted Risk Category: Medium Risk ✓ CORRECT
Predicted Risk Score: 67.8 (Actual: 62.0) - Close prediction
Predicted Resilience Score: 64.9 (Actual: 64.0) - Excellent resilience prediction

Analysis: Professional with below-average credit correctly assessed as medium risk.
Both risk and resilience predictions were highly accurate.
