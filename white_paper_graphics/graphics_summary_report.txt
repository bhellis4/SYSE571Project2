OVERVIEW
========
The white paper graphics directory contains six publication-quality visualizations
that provide comprehensive exploratory analysis of the risk and resilience dataset.
These graphics were designed for academic publication and policy presentation,
revealing key population patterns and factor relationships.

GRAPHIC 1: RISK DISTRIBUTION (01_risk_distribution.png/pdf)
==========================================================
Visual Elements:
- Histogram of calculated risk scores (0-100 scale)
- Overlay density curve showing distribution shape
- Vertical lines marking risk category boundaries
- Color-coded regions (Green=Low, Yellow=Medium, Red=High Risk)

Key Findings:
• Population Distribution: 39.6% Low Risk, 37.1% Medium Risk, 23.3% High Risk
• Risk Score Mean: 63.6 (±18.4 standard deviation)
• Distribution Shape: Roughly normal with slight right skew
• Risk Categories: Well-balanced across population spectrum

Research Implications:
- Confirms realistic risk distribution in population
- Shows majority of individuals fall in low-to-medium risk ranges
- High-risk minority (23.3%) represents targeted intervention population
- Distribution supports validity of scoring algorithm

GRAPHIC 2: DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS (02_demographic_analysis.png/pdf)
================================================================
Visual Elements:
- Multi-panel subplot showing risk by demographic factors
- Age distribution with risk score overlay
- Gender-based risk analysis (8 categories)
- Marital status impact on risk/resilience
- Box plots showing median and quartile ranges

Key Findings:
• Age Pattern: Risk decreases with age (r = -0.242)
  - Younger adults (20-30): Higher risk scores
  - Older adults (50+): Lower risk, higher resilience
• Gender Disparities: Non-conforming identities show higher risk
• Marital Status: Married individuals show lower risk profiles
• Education Effect: Higher education correlates with resilience

Research Implications:
- Age-based risk patterns suggest life experience protective effects
- Demographics reveal systemic inequality patterns
- Marriage provides risk mitigation through social/financial support
- Education serves as resilience building factor

GRAPHIC 3: FINANCIAL FACTORS (03_financial_factors.png/pdf)
==========================================================
Visual Elements:
- Scatter plots of income vs risk/resilience scores
- Credit score distribution analysis
- Debt-to-income ratio impact visualization
- Employment status risk breakdown
- Correlation coefficients displayed

Key Findings:
• Income-Resilience Relationship: Strong positive correlation (r = 0.464)
  - Higher income = significantly higher resilience scores
  - Income provides financial buffer for recovery
• Credit Score Impact: Strong negative correlation with risk (r = -0.383)
  - Poor credit (400-500): High risk population
  - Excellent credit (750+): Low risk, high resilience
• Employment Crisis: 55.4% unemployment rate in high-risk group
• Debt Burden: High debt-to-income ratios concentrate in high-risk categories

Research Implications:
- Financial health is strongest predictor of both risk and resilience
- Credit scores serve as comprehensive financial stability indicators
- Employment loss creates immediate vulnerability escalation
- Debt management critical for risk mitigation

GRAPHIC 4: CORRELATION HEATMAP (04_correlation_heatmap.png/pdf)
=============================================================
Visual Elements:
- Color-coded correlation matrix (20x20 features)
- Hierarchical clustering of related variables
- Correlation coefficients (-1.0 to +1.0 scale)
- Red = positive correlation, Blue = negative correlation

Key Findings:
• Strongest Positive Correlations:
  - Income ↔ Resilience Score (r = 0.464)
  - Credit Score ↔ Resilience Score (r = 0.401)
  - Age ↔ Savings Amount (r = 0.315)
• Strongest Negative Correlations:
  - Credit Score ↔ Risk Score (r = -0.383)
  - Employment Status ↔ Risk Score (r = -0.298)
  - Age ↔ Risk Score (r = -0.242)
• Factor Clusters:
  - Financial Health Cluster: Income, Credit, Savings
  - Risk Amplification Cluster: Debt, Unemployment, Stress

Research Implications:
- Reveals interconnected nature of risk/resilience factors
- Financial indicators form cohesive predictive cluster
- Age provides protective effect across multiple domains
- Stress and mental health amplify financial vulnerabilities

GRAPHIC 5: RISK CATEGORY PROFILES (05_risk_category_profiles.png/pdf)
===================================================================
Visual Elements:
- Comparative profiles across Low/Medium/High risk groups
- Radar charts showing multi-dimensional risk patterns
- Box plots comparing key metrics by risk category
- Population statistics for each risk group

Key Findings:
• High Risk Group Profile (233 individuals, 23.3%):
  - Average Age: 42.2 years (mid-career vulnerability)
  - Average Income: $95,813 (below dataset mean)
  - Average Credit Score: 473 (poor credit range)
  - Unemployment Rate: 55.4% (massive job insecurity)
• Low Risk Group Profile (396 individuals, 39.6%):
  - Average Age: 55.2 years (established life stage)
  - Average Income: $143,505 (significantly above mean)
  - Average Credit Score: 660 (good credit range)
  - Full-time Employment: 36.1% (stable employment)

Research Implications:
- High-risk individuals show multiple overlapping vulnerabilities
- Low-risk group demonstrates financial stability and life experience
- Risk concentration in mid-career age group suggests intervention timing
- Employment status emerges as critical discriminating factor

GRAPHIC 6: SUMMARY STATISTICS (06_summary_statistics.png/pdf)
============================================================
Visual Elements:
- Comprehensive dashboard of key population metrics
- Distribution comparisons across risk categories
- Feature importance rankings visualization
- Summary tables with confidence intervals

Key Findings:
• Overall Population Metrics:
  - Risk Score: 63.6 ± 18.4
  - Resilience Score: 65.3 ± 14.9
  - Net Risk: -1.7 ± 29.6 (slightly resilience-favored)
• Feature Importance Hierarchy:
  1. Employment Status (31.6% importance)
  2. Debt Amount (24.9% importance)
  3. Credit Score (16.7% importance)
• Risk-Resilience Balance: Population shows slight resilience advantage

Research Implications:
- Population demonstrates balanced risk-resilience profile
- Employment emerges as dominant factor across all analyses
- Credit and debt metrics provide complementary risk assessment
- Population suitable for predictive modeling applications
